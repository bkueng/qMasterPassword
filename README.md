### qMasterPassword ###

qMasterPassword is a password manager based on Qt. Access all your passwords
using only a single master password. But in contrast to other managers it does
not store any passwords: Unique passwords are generated from the master password
and a site name. This means you automatically get different passwords for each
account and there is no password file that can be lost or get stolen. There is
also no need to trust any online password service.

The algorithm is described here: 
http://masterpasswordapp.com/algorithm.html
This page also contains other compatible software for various platforms, like
Android or iOS.

See also http://masterpasswordapp.com/what.html to get more familiar with the
concept and reasons why to use it.

qMasterPassword is developed on Linux and also tested on Windows. For Windows
there are prebuilt binaries under
[releases](https://github.com/bkueng/qMasterPassword/releases).
