 <summary>Stateless Master Password Manager</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
qMasterPassword is a graphical password manager. Access all your passwords
using only a single master password. But in contrast to other managers it does
not store any passwords: Unique passwords are generated from the master password
and a site name. This means you automatically get different passwords for each
account and there is no password file that can be lost or get stolen. There is
also no need to trust any online password service.

There exists compatible software for other platforms, for example Android or
iOS.
